Though there is no explicit mention of religion within the poem, Basinski's break from conventional, anti-expressivist poetry performance is also a break from very thing that spawned that type of reading: Religious ritual and readings. Because he takes the reading in a more realistic and expressive manner, he divulges from religious influence, yet his content replicates the roots of religious reading, the psalms. The very fist psalm is one that warns against the dangers of bad influences and unhealthy associations, and is practically mirrored by the line 'I don't like that Judy kid, Stay away.\" "
