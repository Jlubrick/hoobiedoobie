Though there is no explicit mention of religion within the poem, Basinski's break from conventional, anti-expressivist poetry performance is also a break from very thing that spawned that type of reading: Religous ritual and readings. Because he takes the reading in a more realistic and expressive manner, he divulges from religous influence, yet his content replicates the roots of religous reading, the psalms. The very fist psalm is one that warns against the dangers of bad influences and unhealthy assosiations, and is practically mirrorred by the line 'I don't like that Judy kid, Stay away.\" "
