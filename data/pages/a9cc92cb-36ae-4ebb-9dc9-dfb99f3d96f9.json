By this I refer to the content of the poem. Though the spoken aspect defines this performance as an original, it exists as a reflection of a real world relationship between father and daughter, a relationship that is rather ubiquitous. It seems an obvious observation to make that the argument/dialogue presented by Basinski is not a unique situation at all: A father chastising his daughter about being home on time, about who he doesn't like her hanging out with, and remarking about his own responsibility and role in her life. Subsequently, a daughter worrying about her aging father's wellbeing is perhaps a less common, though still a familiar situation. "
