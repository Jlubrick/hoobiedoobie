MacArthur argues for a link between the often neutral, drab, and otherwise monotonous voice given to poetry readings, and the anti-expressivist ritual readings of religious churches. \"In an academic lecture, as in a poetry reading, an understated manner of speaking may aim to focus the audience's attention on the subject matter at hand--the way that a religious ritual intends to focus attention on a sacred text\" (MacArthur 39). A large factor in their similarities is the \"...avoidance of theatricality-justified by the implicit belief that an understated style implies sincerity...\" (MacArthur 41). Whether or not the untheatrical readings of religious ritual resulted in actual sincerity is up for debate, though it's influences have penetrated deep into academia. \"In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the United States and England, the ideal form of poetry reading was formal, dramatic recital, taught through elocution training and sometimes used, misleadingly, to demonstrate literacy\" (MacArthur 41).

          "text": "though it was definitely a purposeful break from the status quo of standard poetry readings. Each line is delievered practically before the last one finishes, as if neither speaker can hold back what they are about to say. As MacArthur mentions, \"A neutral reading style approaches literal monotony, and monotony is associated across cultures with chant and the power to invoke the divine, in religious ritual and the performance of sacred Poetry\" (42). Standard, monotone readings imply importance, they demonstrate a gravitas, or at least the expectation of which. I don't believe Basinski is saying his content is not important, rather I believe he implies the opposite. He makes clear it is not the carefully picked words of reciting poets that are important to him, rather it is the perhaps arbitrary, fast-paced conversation of a father and daughter and they express their concerns for one another.
